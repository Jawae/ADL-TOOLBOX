# The adaptive dictionary learning (ADL) toolbox

ADL is a modular dictionary learning toolbox for plug-and-play sparse approximation and dictionary update steps.

## Overview

<b>ADL implements:</b>
* several of the popular sparse approximation techniques
* many of the dictionary update steps
* overall full dictionary learning algorithms (like MOD, K-SVD, ITKrM etc.)

<b>The main features of the toolbox are:</b>
* Adaptive dictionary size
* Training of replacement atoms
* Several image/synthetic demos
* Generation of synthetic datasets
* Coherence constraints
* Structured dictionaries
* Adaptive sparsity
* Avoid fitting noisy atoms
* Several initialization techniques

<b>Who could use the toolbox?</b>

I. dictionary learning researchers:
* easily develop new ideas
* easily compare with previous work
* reproducibility of results

II. other researchers:
* apply dictionary learning to your application
* no/little parameter tuning
* easily compare several dictionary learning techniques and choose the best one
